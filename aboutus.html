      <p> Alpha Chi Omega believes in fostering a deep sense of community where women can share diverse viewpoints and beliefs, excel academically and demonstrate thoughtful leadership and exploration. Our members are inspired to connect, lead, grow and serve. </p>
            <br> 
      <p>Alpha Chi Omega is also known as a trailblazer in defining and advocating for the sorority experience. Weâ€™ve been a model for other sororities and were the first to adopt board governance, create programming on relationships and speak out about domestic violence on campuses nationwide.</p></th>
